Hover effect on buttons and links
smooth scroll added
Social media icons, with hyper links
MUSIC - Attempted, was unable to get to get autoplay running in JS. https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_audio_autoplay.asp

Things to remember:
READ THE FULL TASK. Started by using background image CSS, and didn't read until later the marking criteria on img usage.
Block out all elements in the skeleton before trying to troubleshoot multiple of the same as they may just behave nice when all placed together.

Be careful of autopopulating <closing tags> when editing in lines.
IF YOU CREATE CLASSES. LINK THEM. STRAIGHT AWAY. Do NOT forget this. It'll save you many headaches.
