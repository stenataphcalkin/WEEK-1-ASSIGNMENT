# WEEK-1-ASSIGNMENT

Found the initial stages a little bit daunting. However, once the skeleton was put together and approached this in the correct manner, I was more than happy playing about with customising the page.

Biggest hurdle was forgetting to put the skeleton together and laying it out rather than trying to work on one element at a time.

# I achieved the requirements of:

    A clear structure with header, footer, navigation
    Responsive layout and links
    Overlaid text on other elements
    Images implemented and loaded correctly with local uploads rather than hotlinks.

# Stretch goals attempted - successfully

    Hover effect on buttons and links - APPLIED
    smooth scroll added - APPLIED
    Social media icons, with hyper links - APPLIED

# Stretch goal attempted - unsuccessfuly

MUSIC - Attempted only, was unable to get to get autoplay running in JS.

# Errors & bugs

No particular errors encountered in the main requirements, those initially thought were forgetting quote marks on the git commit commands, or forgetting to have CD'd into the correct folder after re-opening the project.

Was unable to get the stretch goal music autoplay to run, may have missed a step with how to implement the iframe or player, will revisit in the future.

Most problems encountered was from forgetting functions of VScode that I'm not used to such as autocompleting tags I'm editing leading to double ups of /header etc at one point that caused a headache.

Otherwise, forgetting casing or spellings: put overlays rather than overlay multiple times etc.

# THINGS TO REMEMBER GOING FORWARD

READ THE FULL TASK.  
 DON'T LET THE ADHD GO "we can do that" and rabbithole on that thought thread before fully reading the task which might be different to what I my first thoughts were.
Started by using background image CSS following talk of this in the week, and didn't read until later the marking criteria is on img usage instead.

Block out all elements in the skeleton before trying to troubleshoot multiple of the same as they may just behave nice when all placed together.

Be careful of autopopulating <closing tags> when editing in lines.

IF YOU CREATE CLASSES. LINK THEM. STRAIGHT AWAY. Do NOT forget this. It'll save you many headaches. DOUBLECHECK NAMES AND CASING.

Remember to put everything in the right order in the CSS, and to make sure that things have the right definitions > x:y, x y, x y:x, .x etc

Be mindful of keyboard shortcuts, accidentally cut rather than just copied lines only to find out way later.

Play about more with things in spare time. Look at other websites and sandbox what they're using, see how it works.

# Queries for the future

Was not able to get img to stay static whilst resizing the window, is this possibly reserved for background images (tagged as such rather than just <img>) only?

Is there a way to embed audio in the background of the page without a player like "the old days", or is it required to have a player embedded with various permissions configured to keep the browser happy and mean it is more likely to run with a front-facing player, or already muted?
