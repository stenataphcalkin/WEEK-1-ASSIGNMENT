# WEEK-1-ASSIGNMENT

This is where my reflection will go.

Resources used:

Things to remember:
Block out all elements in the skeleton before trying to troubleshoot multiple of the same as they may just behave nice when all placed together.

Be careful of autopopulating <closing tags> when editing in lines.
IF YOU CREATE CLASSES. LINK THEM. STRAIGHT AWAY. Do NOT forget this. It'll save you many headaches.
