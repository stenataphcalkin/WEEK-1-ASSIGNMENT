# WEEK-1-ASSIGNMENT

Found the initial stages a little bit daunting for being the first page I've put together solo (excluding the taster class exercise). However, once the skeleton was put together, more than happy playing about with customising the page.
Biggest hurdle was forgetting to put the skeleton together and laying it out rather than trying to work on one element at a time.

THINGS TO REMEMBER GOING FORWARD
READ THE FULL TASK. Started by using background image CSS, and didn't read until later the marking criteria on img usage.

Block out all elements in the skeleton before trying to troubleshoot multiple of the same as they may just behave nice when all placed together.

Be careful of autopopulating <closing tags> when editing in lines.

IF YOU CREATE CLASSES. LINK THEM. STRAIGHT AWAY. Do NOT forget this. It'll save you many headaches.

Remember to put everything in the right order in the CSS, and to make sure that things have the right attributions x:y, x y, x y:x, .x

Be mindful of keyboard shortcuts, accidentally cut rather than just copied lines only to find out way later.
Play about more with things in spare time

Stretch goals:
Hover effect on buttons and links
smooth scroll added
Social media icons, with hyper links
MUSIC - Attempted, was unable to get to get autoplay running in JS.

Was not able to get img to stay static whilst resizing the window, possibly reserved for background images (tagged as such) only.
